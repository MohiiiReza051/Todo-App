# Todo App

## Overview
This project serves as a practical exercise to apply learned concepts. Here, I delve into designing and implementing a To-Do. It is implemented using React to master more of what I learned.

## Project Feature
My todo app features:

- **Adding Todos:** Users can easily add new todos to the list.

- **Deleting Todos:** Allows users to remove existing todos from the list.

- **Editing Todos:** Users have the ability to edit todo titles and save changes.

- **Save Todos in Local Storage:** Todos are saved locally in the browser's storage, ensuring data persistence even after closing the page.
